# If Statements

# Comparison Operators Refresher: < > <= >= |= ==
#print(4 > 3)
#print(4 == 3)

# Basic if Statement
#temperature = 80
#if temperature > 75:
#    print("It's beautiful outside!")
#    print(temperature)
#    print("Its cold as shit, however, still beautiful outside!")
    # Watch for indentation! Pay Attention

# if-else
#temperature = 60
#if temperature > 75:
#    print("It's beautiful outside!")
#else:
#    print("It's too chilly!")

# if-elif-else(Do no captiolize!)
#temperature = 81
#if temperature > 80:
#    print("It's beautiful outside!")
#elif temperature > 60:
#    print("Wear a jacket!")
#else:
#    print("It's too chilly!")

# Common Pitfalls to watch out for

#Dont forget colon after condition
#if-elif-else(Do no captiolizelize!)
#Don't forget to indent on print(use TAB Trick)
