# print(2+2) Addition
# print(2-2) Subtraction
# print(2*2) Multiplication
# print(2/2)#Division
# print(9//2)#Floor Division
# print(14%4)# Modules The remainder of a number
# print(4**4)# Expoentiation

# Operator  Precedence: Close to PEMDAS
# parentheses > exponent > mutliplication/division/modules > addition/subtraction

# result = 2**(4/2)     #3 * (2 - 4)
# print(result)

#Using same variable on both sides of assignment: augmented assigbnment
# x = 6
# x = 8
# x -= 2
# print(x)

# What types are returned from these operators? ints use (type(in prent.))
#print(5 / 2)) # (float)
#print(5 // 2)
