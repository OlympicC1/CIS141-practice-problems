# Truth Table
# Problem of the day: (A or B) AND NOT (A AND B) = Boolean
# 1. List variables
# A,B

# 2. Determine the Number of Rows
# 2 possibilties for A
# 2 possibilties for B
# 2x2 combinations of A&B =4

# 3. Create Table Columns
# A B   (A or B)    (A AND B)   NOT(A AND B)    (A or B) AND NOT (A AND B)

# 4. Enumerate ALL Possible (A, B) Combinations
# A B   (A or B)    (A AND B)   NOT(A AND B)    (A or B) AND NOT (A AND
# T/T(true&true)
# T/F
# F/T
# F/F

# 5. Fill Each Row with Sub-Expression Results
# A B   (A OR B)    (A AND B)   NOT(A AND B)    (A OR B) AND NOT (A AND B)
# T T   T            T              F            F
# T F   T            F              T            T
# F T   T            F              T            T
# F F   F            F              T            F
